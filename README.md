# Qap3FullstackDatabases


This is a simple CRUD application using Node.js, Express, and PosrgresSQL.

All SQL create statements, queries, and data insert statement are available to recreate the database for the fictional Happy Restaurant. A restfulAPI including routers and cURL commands to test the API are present.

The data access layer has files for each table in the database and contains functions that are used in both the API and the browser user interface.

The views folder contains all ejs files used in the express app to create a simple user interface. There is also a css file in the public folder to help ease the use of the application and make it more attractive to the user.
